    summary: Describes all available callbacks
    description: All Transport Operator endpoints need the ability to send a notification to the MaaS provider to give updates to station, asset, booking, tickets, and payments.  A MaaS Provider can call this endpoint to get a list of webhooks that can be used to provide callbacks for this service.  Each endpoint has it's own callback URL that a MaaS provider can connect and de-connect to.

    # TODO: Discuss how to implement this
    For security purposes all registered webhooks will time out after a period of 7 days to stop callbacks becoming stale.

    Ttransport providers must also send over an agreed authentication key to ensure that the callback is from a valid source.  For secuirty reasons it is recommended that the MaaS Provider also sets up a whitelist of urls for the origin of the webhook from a Transport Provider.
